# Epic Library

A modern windows Library management system with a sprinkle of anime.

**STACK :** _C#, SQL_

The completed project should be something like this:

- _Windows Application with user Authentication_
- _User can add Books/clients to the database_
- _User can sell/rent Books to clients and it'll be added to their record_

## Current Version

- Added Tables to the app.
- User Can Now Add Books and Members to Database.

## Wanted Features

- Validate User Input.
- User Authentication.

## Found Bugs

- UC_Books and UC_Members got Errors but doesn't seem to be breaking errors.
